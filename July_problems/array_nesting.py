"""
A zero-indexed array A of length N contains all integers from 0 to N-1. (all elements are distinct)
Find and return the longest length of set S, where S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]], A[A[A[i]]], ... } subjected to the rule below.

Suppose the first element in S starts with the selection of element A[i] of index = i,
the next element in S should be A[A[i]], and then A[A[A[i]]]â€¦
By that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in S.
