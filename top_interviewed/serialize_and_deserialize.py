"""
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link
to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
